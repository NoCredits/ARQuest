Game idea.

18/2/19
Right now, the Repository is empty. We are still brainstorming for idea's, but Hence, you have to make a start!

## Idea 1
- Single-player mode
    - multi-player via 'shared' mode? ("hot seat")
- Table-top adventure game
- Classic fantasy setting
    - or Sci-fi?
- Slay enemies and get nice loot (progression elements)
    - "dungeon crawler"

- Long/infinite play mode (auto-generate replayable content)
    - Autogenerated content m
- Player classes (different playstyles)
- Leveling? Or purely stats increases via loot?

# Technical requirements
- Cross-platform
    - iOS/Android?
    - PC/Windows?
    - MacOS?
    - Linux?
- Audio
    - how feasible is it to make something?
    - are there unlicensed fitting music, e.g. classical music?

# Idea 2
- Turnbased?
- Short game or long game?
    - with or without savegame?
- Autogenerated and everytime different challenges
- Tabletop: topview? firstperson? sidescroller? 
- cartoonesk? black and white? Realistic? 
- simple graphics? or artistwork?
    - Perhaps use childrengraphics? 
- Leaderboard? Hall of fame? Social elements?

# tech 2
- Html/CSS/Javascript based game
    - Easy to port
    - android/ios just add a browsercontrol to the app
    - lots of existing frameworks like https://github.com/melonjs/melonJS  etc available
    - JQuery 
- tilebased graphics
    - lots of tools available
- multiplayer
    - using browserbased games makes it difficult to play using sharedmode. Serverbased is easier to accomplisch (Mysql - PHP-api). User creation etc
