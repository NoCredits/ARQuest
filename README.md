Some basic rules

Just an idea again. Please add yours!!

Moving
Please cannot move diagonal
cannot move to an occupied Square
They are allowed to pass through an occupied Square
cannot move through Monsters, traps or walls
 
Players are allowed to do different kinds of actions throughout their turn

They can move in straight lines. Basically 5 squares(?)
Or:
They can fight, 
cast spells or use magic, 
can search for traps or treasures or hidden doorways,
open doors,
use abilities ,
remove traps

Players are allowed to first move and then do an action 
Or:
do an action and then move. 
They are not allowed to do same action twice. so they can move and fights, but not allowed to fight and fight again.

Combats
Melee  are only allowed at touching squares to monsters
Distance  damage is  only allowed at a distance. the distance depends on the kind of weapon or magic.

when a player steps in a trap  the trap  stays visible. there are  different kind of  traps.

I agree with your basic principles for **moving**; can move through friends but not hostiles.
Maybe some things can modify movement rate? (e.g. heavy armour or light-footed elf/thief?), I'd say no more than 1-2 in either direction (if we base at 4 then +1 is a 25% increase after all).

Agreed on **actions**.
Is it possible to use both magic and normal weapons?
Do we have ranged attacks? If so, may you both ranged and melee attack? (and do they use the same stats?)
Agreed on not fight+fight (maybe specific things would allow it; e.g. berserking or potion of heroism?)
I think it's okay to move+move though?

**Monsters** abide by the same rules as players (do monsters also have classes? Or just archtypes? Maybe only "hero"-monsters have classes?)

Agreed on **range**; you need to touch base to fight in melee (diagonal/corner-corner touch allowed?).
If you move through a figure that is in melee, then you risk getting hit?

**Traps**.
If you step in a trap, then you lose the rest of your turn? Or just lose the rest of the move you were executing?
I like the idea of having different kinds of traps (and not necessarily the one stepping in it is hit; e.g. someone standing in the way? :))

Simple **classes** for simplicity? Maybe even just the 4 basic AD&D classes? (fighter, thief, cleric, mage)
Everyone can do all skills but with different success chances? Or skills are locked for specific classes?

Is there a weight/number-limited of loot you can carry?
Does it cost an action to switch gear? To switch to another weapon? To switch from melee to ranged (and vice versa)?
