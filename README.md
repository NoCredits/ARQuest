Game idea.

18/2/19
Right now, the Repository is empty. We are still brainstorming for idea's, but Hence, you have to make a start!

## Idea 1
- Single-player mode
    - multi-player via 'shared' mode? ("hot seat")
- Table-top adventure game
- Classic fantasy setting
    - or Sci-fi?
- Slay enemies and get nice loot (progression elements)
    - "dungeon crawler"

- Long/infinite play mode (auto-generate replayable content)
    - Autogenerated content m
- Player classes (different playstyles)
- Leveling? Or purely stats increases via loot?

# Technical requirements
- Cross-platform
    - iOS/Android?
    - PC/Windows?
    - MacOS?
    - Linux?
- Audio
    - how feasible is it to make something?
    - are there unlicensed fitting music, e.g. classical music?

# Idea 2
- Turnbased?
- Short game or long game?
    - with or without savegame?
- Autogenerated and everytime different challenges
- Tabletop: topview? firstperson? sidescroller?
- cartoonesk? black and white? Realistic?
- simple graphics? or artistwork?
    - Perhaps use childrengraphics?
- Leaderboard? Hall of fame? Social elements?

## Anders comments, 2019-02-20:
- I was thinking turn-based, yes. (makes "hot seat" playing easier too I guess, if we opt for that kind of multiplayer)
- Short or long? Good question. I was thinking long via replayability, but short enough that you can have a stage/level/session done in ~30-45mins?
- I hadn't considered anything other than isometric (or topdown) to be honest. I was thinking pieces-on-a-board (e.g. like "Battle Chess"), but I realise now that it was quite a few unconscious design choices taken. :)
- Cartoonesk style sounds fun - although I'm also good with a more realistics style.
- How much work is there in making the textures themselves? I am not much of a graphic artist, but if there are good tools for generating.... ;)
- I like the Hall of Fame idea (and I am a bit of a sucker for in-game achievements too :))
- Social elements? And/or online elements? I think I'd like to be able to play in an offline mode at least; but these days there's WIFI and 3G everywhere, so it's not a big problem. :)

# tech 2
- Html/CSS/Javascript based game
    - Easy to port
    - android/ios just add a browsercontrol to the app
    - lots of existing frameworks like https://github.com/melonjs/melonJS  etc available
    - JQuery
- tilebased graphics
    - lots of tools available
- multiplayer
    - using browserbased games makes it difficult to play using sharedmode. Serverbased is easier to accomplisch (Mysql - PHP-api). User creation etc
