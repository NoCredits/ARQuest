Game idea.

18/2/19
Right now, the Repository is empty. We are still brainstorming for idea's, but Hence, you have to make a start!

## Idea 1
- Single-player mode
    - multi-player via 'shared' mode? ("hot seat")
- Table-top adventure game
- Classic fantasy setting
    - or Sci-fi?
- Slay enemies and get nice loot (progression elements)
    - "dungeon crawler"
- Long/infinite play mode (auto-generate replayable content)
- Player classes (different playstyles)
- Leveling? Or purely stats increases via loot?

# Technical requirements
- Cross-platform
    - iOS/Android?
    - PC/Windows?
    - MacOS?
    - Linux?
- Audio
    - how feasible is it to make something?
    - are there unlicensed fitting music, e.g. classical music?
